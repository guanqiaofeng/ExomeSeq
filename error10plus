Removing output files of failed job Sequenza since they might be corrupted:
results/Sequenza/BPTO93T
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message

Fix
change `/cluster/home/selghamr/workflows/ExomeSeq/resources/centromeres.txt` to `/cluster/home/t135250uhn/workflow/ExomeSeq/resources/centromeres.txt` in `/cluster/home/t135250uhn/workflow/ExomeSeq/workflow/scripts/SequenzaSingleSample_v2.1_hg38.R`
